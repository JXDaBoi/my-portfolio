Self-learned the basics of it back in the middle high school
On 2023, picked up Python again because requested by friends to create a Discord Bot (420 lines)
<img src="/images/snkrs-code.png" alt="NoSNKRS Code" width="50%" style="padding-top: 10px;">
The Discord Bot basically gets all the latest shoes available on Nike SNKRS's api, including the upcoming ones and also non-listed ones
It also shows their stock level for each size, price and other details as shown below:

[Disclaimer: The bot is only for private use and has stopped since last year]

The bot is previously hosted on AWS for automation, and Firebase is used to saved all the information
Then, a website based on ReactJS is created to dynamically show the organized information

                <h2 style="text-decoration: underline; margin-bottom: 5px;">Selenium</h2>
                <pre style="margin-top: 5px;">
As for Selenium, it was used to try access the Nike Website and fast purchase of the shoes
But failed as Selenium has their own signature craved into their crawler during webcrawling on Nike Website
And that triggers the Akamai and Kasada, which both is antibot measures on Nike Website.
Tried to study both Akamai and Kasada on that period to bypass it,
but it took almost a week to just understand a very small part of it and then proceed to abandon using Selenium.

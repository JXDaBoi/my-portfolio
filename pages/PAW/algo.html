The link above showcase the code for below two problems:
• Q1 - Sort Parcels with Quick Sort Algorithm (& find a better algorithm)
• Q2 - Batches of Oranges (Algorithm Optimization Question)

As for Algorithm Analysis and Design, it is a major elective course that I have chosen in Year 2.
I took this course because it could help me to have a better algorithm understanding.
The course helped in strengthening my logical thinking and also definitely boost my self-learning ability
as C++ is harder compared to other programming languages that I have learned.
I can have faster and better understanding of other programming languages.

In this course's assignment work, I have learned a lot about the algorithms, which I think they will be handy
to apply it into numerous of applications, especially in tweaking AI's behaviour in games

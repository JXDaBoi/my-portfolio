Game Design is a course which taught us how to design a game, whether it is the game mechanics, game logic or game layout.
In this course's final project, my friend knew that I have prior experience on web development so he suggest to make our final project website based.
In a group of four, he gave my other two groupmates task to design the cards, while I focus on dealing with the frontend.

This is the first time I am using ReactJS and also integrating websocket from my friend's backend.
Which considers as a huge achievement for myself as I consider it as a great plus of knowledge for my web development.

<b>In the images below, they are the implementation of ReactJS, TypeScript and also integration of communicating with websocket.</b>

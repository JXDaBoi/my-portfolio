Embedded Game Design and Development is a course that taught me how to develop a mobile game and also small games.
My scripting knowledge got strengthen in this course as I learned how to use Scriptable Object, which is a handy object used to keep track of 
user's stats.
In the Final Project, I did most of the scripting for the game for it to work, such as
 • Enemy Movement & Combat
 • Player Movement & Combat
 • Player Experience Manager
 • MiniBoss and FinalBoss AI
 • Shooting Mechanics
 • Random Reward Crates
 • Shop Manager
 • Upgrade Manager

The Upgrade Manager is one of the huge mechanics that plays an important role in the whole game.
It handles the upgrade of weapons & player's stats during the gameplay.
The Upgrade Manager can randomized the upgrades, shows the special upgrades when the specific condition is met.
